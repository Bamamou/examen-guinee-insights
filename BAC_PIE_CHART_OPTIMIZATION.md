# BAC Pie Chart Optimization

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The BAC pie chart was cluttered and unreadable with 70 exam center labels overlapping each other, making it impossible to interpret the data visualization.

## ✨ **Solution Implemented**

### **BAC Pie Charts (Clean & Minimal)**
- **No Labels**: Removed all text labels from pie slices
- **No Legend**: Removed the legend to eliminate visual clutter
- **Hover Tooltips Only**: Users can hover over any pie slice to see:
  - Center name
  - Number of candidates
  - Clean, readable information on demand

### **BEPC/CEE Pie Charts (Labels Preserved)**
- **Keep Labels**: Continue showing region labels since there are only 8 regions
- **Keep Legend**: Legend remains useful for regional data
- **Manageable Display**: 8 regions are easily readable with labels

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

```typescript
// Dynamic label control based on exam type
label={isBac ? false : ({ region, percent }) => `${region} ${(percent * 100).toFixed(0)}%`}

// Conditional legend rendering
{!isBac && <Legend />}
```

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before (BAC)**
- ❌ 70 overlapping center labels
- ❌ Cluttered legend with too many items
- ❌ Unreadable pie chart
- ❌ Poor user experience

### **After (BAC)**
- ✅ Clean pie chart with color-coded segments
- ✅ No visual clutter
- ✅ Hover tooltips provide detailed information
- ✅ Much better user experience

### **BEPC/CEE (Unchanged)**
- ✅ 8 region labels remain visible
- ✅ Legend still helpful
- ✅ Optimal for regional data

## 🎨 **User Experience**

1. **Clean Visual**: BAC pie chart now looks professional and uncluttered
2. **Interactive Information**: Users discover data by hovering, creating an engaging experience
3. **Context-Aware**: System automatically adapts based on data complexity
4. **Consistent Logic**: BEPC/CEE keep their familiar, readable format

The pie chart is now much more usable and provides a better analytical experience for BAC exam data! 🚀
