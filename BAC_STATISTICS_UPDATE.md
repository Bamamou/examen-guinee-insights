## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

Updated `backend/src/services/examService.ts` in the `getDashboardStats()` method to include official BAC statistics alongside the existing BEPC and CEE statistics.

The dashboard now shows accurate candidate numbers and pass rates that match the official Guinea Ministry of Education (DGECS) statistics.

## âœ… Verification

Created and ran `testBacStats.js` which confirmed all three BAC streams now display the correct official statistics:
- âœ… BAC-SM: 27,491 total candidates, 26.74% pass rate
- âœ… BAC-SE: 26,807 total candidates, 33.08% pass rate  
- âœ… BAC-SS: 42,565 total candidates, 31.46% pass rate

The frontend dashboard will now display these official numbers when users select any BAC option.
